# Testing Instructions for Weather Aggregation System

This document outlines the steps to test the main functionality of the system.

---

## 1. Basic Startup

Verify the system starts and communicates correctly.

1. Start the Aggregation Server:
    ```bash
    java AggregationServer
    ```
    - The server should start and wait for requests.

2. Start a Content Server:
    ```bash
    java ContentServer
    ```
    - The content server should send weather data to the aggregation server.

3. Run the GET Client:
    ```bash
    java GETClient
    ```
    - The client should receive and display weather data from the aggregation server.

## 2. Lamport Clock Testing

Ensure Lamport clocks synchronize correctly between servers and clients.

1. Start the Aggregation Server.
2. Run a Content Server to send weather data.
3. Run the GET Client to fetch weather data.

- The Lamport clock should update correctly between all components during communication.

## 3. PUT and GET Requests

Test ability to handle `PUT` and `GET` requests.

1. Start the Aggregation Server.
2. Run a Content Server to send weather data using `PUT`.
3. Run the GET Client to retrieve data using `GET`.

- Weather data should be correctly stored and fetched.

---

## 4. Data Expiration

Test the 30-second data expiration mechanism.

1. Start the Aggregation Server.
2. Run a Content Server to send data.
3. Wait 30 seconds and run the GET Client.

- The weather data should expire after 30 seconds and no longer be available.

---

## 5. Fault Tolerance

Verify replication and fault tolerance.

1. Start the Aggregation Server.
2. Run two Content Servers to send data.
3. Stop one Content Server and run the GET Client.

- The data should still be available even if one Content Server goes down.

---

## 6. Error Handling and Retries

Test the retry mechanism when the server is unavailable.

1. Start the Aggregation Server and a Content Server.
2. Stop the Aggregation Server and attempt to send data from the Content Server.
3. Restart the Aggregation Server and observe retry behavior.

- The Content Server should retry and successfully send data once the server is back online.
